#🌱 Smart Farming: Predictive Modeling and Geographic Insights from IoT and Satellite Data

📌 Project Description

This project explores a simulated yet realistic smart farming dataset containing environmental, operational and geospatial data from 500 farms located in India, the United States and Africa. The goal is to analyze and model the factors that influence crop yield and crop health, integrating machine learning techniques, geographic visualizations and data-driven storytelling.

🎯 Objectives

1. Geographic storytelling: Map and visualize how crop yield, moisture and health change based on geographic location.
2. Disease classification: Build a predictive model to identify crop health status (None, Mild, Moderate, Severe) based on environmental conditions.
3. Crop yield forecasting: Use regression models to estimate the achievable kg/ha based on weather, soil and operational variables.
